# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Introduction to AWS Machine Learning Final Project

## Overview
In this project, we will apply the knowledge and methods learnt in the Introduction to Machine Learning course to compete in a Kaggle competition using the AutoGluon library.

Students will create a Kaggle account if they do not already have one, download the Bike Sharing Demand dataset, and train a model using AutoGluon. They will then submit their initial results for a ranking.

After completion of the first workflow, we iterate on the process by trying to improve the score. This is accomplished by adding more features to the dataset and tuning some of the hyperparameters available with AutoGluon.

3 project files:
* Jupyter notebook with code run to completion
* HTML export of the jupyter notebbook
* Markdown or PDF file of the report


### Dependencies

```
Python 3.7
MXNet 1.8
Pandas >= 1.2.4
AutoGluon 0.2.0 
```

## Project Instructions

1. Create an account with Kaggle.
2. Download the Kaggle dataset using the kaggle python library.
3. Train a model using AutoGluonâ€™s Tabular Prediction and submit predictions to Kaggle for ranking.
4. Use Pandas to do some exploratory analysis and create a new feature, saving new versions of the train and test dataset.
5. Rerun the model and submit the new predictions for ranking.
6. Tune at least 3 different hyperparameters from AutoGluon and resubmit predictions to rank higher on Kaggle.
7. Write up a report on how improvements (or not) were made by either creating additional features or tuning hyperparameters, and why you think one or the other is the best approach to invest more time in.
